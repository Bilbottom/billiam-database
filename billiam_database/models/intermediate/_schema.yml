    description: >
      The items corresponding to each of the transactions.

      Note that these are only items that have corresponding transactions in
      `int__transactions`. Most tests can be omitted since they are tested in
      the staging layer.

      This may be decommissioned in the future as it's not really doing much.

    description: >
      The transactions and their core measures.

      Note that these are only transactions that cause some net movement in my
      overall balances -- for example, paying off a credit card is being
      considered as not changing my net balance, and has been excluded.
