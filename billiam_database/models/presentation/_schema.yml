          The total net cost of all non-essential items on the date.

          Non-essential items are items not in the following categories:

          - Bills

          - Council Tax

          - Rent

          - Wage

        description: >
          The proportion of non-essential cost to the total cost on the date.

        description: >
          The proportion of meeting time to the total time spent working on the
          date, adjusted for overworking.

          The adjustment is made by taking the lesser of the total time spent
          working and 7.5 hours. This is to account for working additional hours
          on a day to not deflate the metric.

          The values are:

          - `0`: Detail-level aggregates per task.

          - `1`: Task-level aggregates.

        description:
          The earliest timestamp than an event was recorded for the task (or

      - name: end_time
        data_type: timestamp
        constraints:
          - type: not_null
        description:

          and detail).
  - name: pl__transactions_cube

      Not helpful for me, but illustrates the usage of incremental models.
