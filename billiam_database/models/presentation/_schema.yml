          Non-essential items are items not in the following categories:

          The proportion of meeting time to the total time spent working on the
          date, adjusted for overworking.

          The adjustment is made by taking the lesser of the total time spent
          working and 7.5 hours. This is to account for working additional hours
          on a day to not deflate the metric.

          The time, in minutes, between entries.

          Note that this will never be a true measure of how much time is spent
          on a task since additional things can happen _between_ entries, and
          the interval over which this should be correspond to is ambiguous.

          That is, an interval of 15 minutes on an entry recorded at 10:00 could
          mean any of the following:

          - The entry corresponds to the last 15 minutes, 09:45 to 10:00.

          - The entry corresponds to the following 15 minutes, 10:00 to 10:15.

          - The entry corresponds to the surrounding 15 minutes, 09:52:30 to
            10:07:30.

          - The entry has over-stated how much time was spent on the task
            because time was spent on other tasks before 10:00 and after 10:00.

          In a future iteration of this project, this will instead be captured
          in a seed with the from- and to- employment dates.
