# This isn't a library so there aren't any "packages" to include, but
# `poetry install` complains that:
#   > billiam_database is not a package.
#
# Poetry only supports an "application build" via its CLI by using the
# `--no-root` flag which doesn't currently exist in the `pyproject.toml`
# file configuration yet, see:
#   - https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2458
#   - https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1132
#
# Until this is supported, we'll have to just remember to include the
# `--no-root` flag when running `poetry install`:
#   $ poetry install --no-root --sync --with dev
